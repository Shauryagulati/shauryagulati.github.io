# Hi there

I’m Shaurya, an AI product builder and data scientist currently pursuing my Master’s at Carnegie Mellon University. I design and develop intelligent systems that merge machine learning, product thinking, and human-centered design, from generative AI tools and RAG pipelines to multi-agent applications.

Beyond technology, I’m deeply interested in human behavior, storytelling, and systems thinking. My goal is to build products that don’t just work — but think, adapt, and create impact at scale.
