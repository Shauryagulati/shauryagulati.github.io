## *UCI Air Quality Prediction with MLFlow*

### • Python, MLFlow, XGBoost  
### • Docker, Kafka, Evidently AI, EDA, Model Monitoring  

Developed a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting air quality using the UCI dataset. The system included experiment tracking with MLFlow, real-time data ingestion via Kafka, and a prediction API containerized with Docker.

Built monitoring dashboards with Evidently AI to detect data drift and model performance degradation. Focused on reproducibility, modular ML design, and continuous deployment with robust evaluation workflows.
