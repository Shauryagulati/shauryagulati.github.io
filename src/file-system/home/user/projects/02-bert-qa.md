## *Question Answering System using BERT & Azure ML*

### • Python, BERT, Azure ML  
### • Hugging Face, Deep Learning, API Deployment  

Fine-tuned a BERT-based question-answering system to match user queries with relevant answer sentences from the SQuAD dataset. Implemented semantic similarity scoring, sentence embeddings, and Jaccard/TF-IDF baselines for benchmarking.

Deployed the model using Azure Machine Learning, optimizing the scoring pipeline for both latency and accuracy. Demonstrated full-stack ML deployment—from fine-tuning to packaging, serving, and real-time inference.
