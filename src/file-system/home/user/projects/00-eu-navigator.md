EU Navigator is a multiagentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed as a Personal Learning Portal for exploring European Union tech, data, and AI legislation. It integrates multiple specialized AI agents for planning, retrieval, synthesis, and review—enabling evidence-based legal analysis with verified citations.

Built using LangChain, FAISS, and Llama 3.1, it preserves EU legal structure through section-based chunking and semantic search. The Streamlit-based interface supports modular exploration, progress tracking, and reflection journaling. Evaluation was performed with RAGAS to measure faithfulness and relevancy.
