## *YouTube Video Summarizer*

### • Python, LangChain, OpenAI API  
### • YouTube Transcript API, Streamlit, RAG  

Built an intelligent summarization tool that extracts and condenses insights from YouTube videos using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system automatically retrieves transcripts via the YouTube API, segments them, and uses an LLM to produce concise, structured summaries.

Implemented chunk-level embeddings and semantic retrieval to handle long videos efficiently. Users can input a video URL and receive timestamped summaries, key takeaways, and topic segmentation — all within an interactive Streamlit interface.
